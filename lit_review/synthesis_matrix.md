# Synthesis Matrix for the Literature Review

| _Source_                       | _Model_            | _System Type_  | _Ecological Effect_ |
| ------                         | -----              | -----------    | -----------------   |
| **Smith et al. 2022**          | Foundation species | Restored Reefs | Restored reefs supported populations of mud crabs = to ref. reefs. |
|                                |                    |                | Restored reefs increased in oyster pop. stability with time and matched ref. reef stability when > 7 yo. |
| **Newell 1988**                | Foundation species | Wild reefs     | pre-industrial oyster population could remove 23 -- 44% or phytoplankton C production, indicating that they significantly altered system C cycling. |
|                                |                    |                | Following oyster decline benthic filter feeding niche has become occupied by other species (e.g., corbicula), indicating a significant shift in food-web structure. |
|                                |                    |                | Following oyster decline, the reduction in pseudofeces production has reduced benthic-pelagic coupling, indicating a sig. change in material and energy flow. |
|                                |                    |                | Following oyster decline zooplankton have replaced oyster larvae as the dominant pelagic filter feeders, indicating a sig. shift in food-web structure. |
| **Kennedy et al. 2011**        | Ecosystem services | Restored Reefs | Oyster restoration in VA and MD is mainly adding shell and transplanting seed oysters onto "open" bars to support fishing. |
| **Lenihan 1999**               | Foundation species | Restored reefs | Oyster growth and condition was greatest on the most intact reefs, suggesting that there are emergent "physical-biological coupling" effects of intact reefs. |
| **Searles et al. 2022**        | Foundation species | Restored reefs | Macroinvertebrate communities recovered on reef interiors but not margins following restoration, suggesting possible relevant emergent properties with reef structure. |
|                                |                    |                | Macroinvertebrate diversity and community composition was related to reef characteristics and physical factors affected by the reef. |
| **Naylor et al. 2021**         | Ecosystem services | Aquaculture    | Bivalve aquaculture is modeled as "sustainable" because it is "extractive" in that the bivalves derive feed from the natural abundance of seston in the system. |
|                                |                    |                | Bivalve aquaculture provides the ecosystem services of nutrient and phytoplankton removal, habitat augmentation, and shoreline stabilization. |
| **Mercaldo-Allen et al. 2023** | Ecosystem services | Aquaculture    | Oyster aquaculture cages support higher fish abundance than unstructured habitat and natural rock in locations where structure is limited. |
