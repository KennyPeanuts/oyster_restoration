# Synthesis Matrix for the Literature Review

| Source                  | Model              | System Type    | Ecological Effect |
| ------                  | -----              | -----------    | ----------------- |
| **Smith et al. 2022**   | Foundation species | Restored Reefs | Restored reefs supported populations of mud crabs = to ref. reefs. |
|                         |                    |                | Restored reefs increased in oyster pop. stability with time and matched ref. reef stability when > 7 yo. |
| **Newell 1988**         | Foundation species | Wild reefs     | pre-industrial oyster population could remove 23 -- 44% or phytoplankton C production, indicating that they significantly altered system C cycling. |
|                         |                    |                | Following oyster decline benthic filter feeding niche has become occupied by other species (e.g., corbicula), indicating a significant shift in food-web structure. |
|                         |                    |                | Following oyster decline, the reduction in pseudofeces production has reduced benthic-pelagic coupling, indicating a sig. change in material and energy flow. |
|                         |                    |                | Following oyster decline zooplankton have replaced oyster larvae as the dominant pelagic filter feeders, indicating a sig. shift in food-web structure. |
| **Kennedy et al. 2011** | Foundation species | Restored Reefs | Oyster restoration in VA and MD is mainly adding shell and transplanting seed oysters onto "open" bars to support fishing. |
