          <li>Ecosystem services support human well&ndash;being, which is a description of human values (e.g., material wealth, freedom, security, health, etc&hellip;). </li>
          <li>Human well&ndashl;being is the "central focus for assessment" [p. 7] of ecosystem services and therefore conceptualized as outside of the ecosystem.</li>

          <li>The authors conclude that due to high (presumably human) demand for ecosystem services, one service cannot be increased by human activity without a trade&ndash;off reduction in another service. This view sees the magnitude of ecosystem services as under human control.</li>
          <li>The authors indicate that human demand for ecosystem services has reduced the capacity of ecosystems to provide services, indicating human control over ecosystem service delivery.</li>
          <li>Wealth allows more access and use of ecosystem services.</li>
          <li>Ecosystem services are embedded within political and social systems.</li>
          <li>Human well&ndash;being is outside of the ecosystem but in relationship with it where both well&ndash;being and ecosystem dynamics are affected by each other but also other factors independent of their relationship (e.g., political systems).</li>
