            In <em>figure 2</em> [p. 1307], the authors illustrate the "social&ndash;ecological" system where biophysical and social <em>drivers</em> affect social and biophysical <em>variables</em> at multiple scales, which then have impacts on human <em>actors</em>. There is a lot to unpack from this figure but three observations are:
              <ul>
                <li>The biophysical and social are shown as equivalent in terms of impact and effect size.</li>
                <li>There is nothing in the model that doesn't point to humans, so all the processes ultimately are shown to be connected through their impact on "human actors".</li>
                <li>Only humans are identified as <em>actors</em>, all other components of the system are <em>drivers</em> or <em>variables</em>.</li>
              </ul>
           </li> 
           <li>The ability to spatially and temporally displace costs can lead to degradation of ecosystem services even when the trade&ndash;offs are well quantified.</li> 
        </ul>  
      </th>
      <td><!-- Both versions of the <em>ecosystem services</em> concept are reductive and additive.-->
        <ul>
          <li class="neg">Social&ndash;ecological systems are characterized by non&ndash;linear and threshold dynamics that are poorly understood.</li>
