\section{Application of Models to Oyster Restoration and Aquaculture}

Oysters and oyster reefs are modeled using both the ecosystem services model and the foundation species model. Sometimes both of these models are referenced in the same paper \cite{mercaldo-allen_oyster_2023}. There is evidence in the literature to support the use of both of these models for understanding oyster ecology. For example, \citeA{newell_ecological_1988} reports that prior to their depletion during the 19th and 20th centuries, oyster reefs could remove 22 --- 44\% of phytoplankton C production in the Chesapeake Bay, indicating a significant alteration of material cycling in the system consistent with the role of a foundation species \cite{fields_foundation_2022}. Other studies support the idea that the function of oyster reefs is dependent on their structural development indicating that it is the creation of a particular habitat and its associated conditions that drives the effect. \citeA{searls_oyster_2022} found that macroinvertebrate communities recovered on the interior of restored reefs but not their margins, suggesting that a certain oyster density or reef structure was required to facilitate the colonization of the macroinvertebrates.
