\section{Application of Models to Oyster Restoration and Aquaculture}

Oysters and oyster reefs are conceptualized using both the ecosystem services model and the foundation species model. Sometimes both of these models are referenced in the same paper \cite{mercaldo-allen_oyster_2023}. There is evidence in the literature to support the use of both of these models for understanding oyster ecology. The foundation species model proposes that an ecosystem contains one or a few species that have a disproportional effect on community structure by altering the physical, chemical, and biological processes of an ecosystem to facilitate and stabilize a specific community \cite{fields_foundation_2022}. The presence of the foundation species creates and stabilizes the physical environment by minimizing fluctuations in temperature, moisture, pH, or other physical parameters \cite{ellison_loss_2005}. Foundation species can also alter ecosystem production through changes in nutrient cycling, in some cases increasing \cite{fields_foundation_2022} or decreasing \cite{ellison_loss_2005} nutrient availability. In some cases, the main effect of the foundation species is to literally build the three--dimensional habitat that other species require \cite{mercaldo-allen_oyster_2023}. Because they are capable of building large biogenic structures that can persist for decades to centuries \cite{lockwood_conservation_2019} and processing large volumes of materials via filtration \cite{newell_ecological_1988} oyster reefs can be conceptualized as foundation species where they occur. For example, \citeA{newell_ecological_1988} reports that prior to their depletion during the 19th and 20th centuries, oyster reefs could remove 22 --- 44\% of phytoplankton C production in the Chesapeake Bay, indicating a significant alteration of material cycling in the system consistent with the role of a foundation species \cite{fields_foundation_2022}. Other studies support the idea that the function of oyster reefs is dependent on their structural development indicating that it is the creation of a particular habitat and its associated conditions that drives the effect. \citeA{searles_oyster_2022} found that macroinvertebrate communities recovered on the interior of restored reefs but not their margins, suggesting that a certain oyster density or reef structure was required to facilitate the colonization of the macroinvertebrates.
