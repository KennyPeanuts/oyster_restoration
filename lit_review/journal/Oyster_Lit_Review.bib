                Declines of the Eastern oyster,
                Crassostrea virginica
                , and its numerous ecological benefits have spurred oyster restoration initiatives. Successful restoration of a self-sustaining oyster population requires evaluating the temporal and spatial patterns of recruitment (settlement and survival) of oyster larvae in the target waterbody. Restoration of the Eastern oyster population in the Maryland Coastal Bays (MCBs), USA, a shallow lagoonal estuary, is of interest to federal, state, and non-governmental, but the location and timing of natural recruitment is not known.
              
            
            
              Methods
              We assessed the spatial and temporal variation in oyster larval recruitment throughout the MCBs using horizontal ceramic tiles and PVC plates. Newly settled oyster larvae (recruits) were monitored biweekly from June to September 2019 and 2020 at 12 sites in the MCBs and a comparison site in Wachapreague, Virginia. Water quality measurements collected included temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity. The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the most effective substrate and design for monitoring oyster recruitment, (2) the spatial and temporal distribution of oyster larval recruitment in the MCBs, and (3) patterns in oyster larval recruitment that would be applicable to other lagoonal estuaries.
            
            
              Results
              (1) Ceramic tiles were more effective than PVC plates for recruiting oyster larvae. (2) Peak settlement began during the period from late June through July, and oyster recruitment was greatest at sites closest to the Ocean City and Chincoteague inlets. (3) Areas near broodstock that have slow flushing rates to retain larvae may provide the best environments for recruitment of oysters to lagoonal estuaries.
            
            
              Discussion
              As the first study on oyster larval recruitment in the MCBs, our results provide insight into their spatial and temporal distribution, methods that can serve as a foundation for future recruitment studies in other lagoonal estuaries, and baseline data that can be used to inform stakeholders and evaluate the success of oyster restoration projects in MCBs.},

	abstract = {Oyster populations in Virginia's waters of Chesapeake Bay were lightly exploited until the early 1800s, when industrial fishery vessels first arrived, driven south from New England due to the collapse of northeastern oyster fisheries. Early signs of overexploitation and habitat degradation were evident by the 1850s. The public fishery, where oyster fishers harvest on state-owned bottom, rapidly developed after the Civil War and peaked in the early 1880s. Declines were noted by the late 1880s and eventually prompted the creation of Virginia's shell-planting and oyster-seed (young-of-the-year, YOY) moving repletion program in the 1920s. Despite management and increasing repletion efforts, the public fishery collapsed (annual landings {\textless}10\% of peak historical landings) by the early 1960s. The private leasehold fishery, in which individuals rent areas outside the public grounds to plant shells and oysters for their own private use, surpassed the public fishery by the late 1920s, which partly masked this decline due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and diseases until both public and private fisheries completely collapsed in the mid-1980s after a third disease outbreak. This disease outbreak was likely related to warming waters. Overfishing and concomitant habitat loss followed a pattern of sequential population collapses observed in wild oyster fisheries along the Coastlines of the United States and worldwide. In recent years, expanding hatchery-produced seed oysters and aquaculture significantly increased leasehold landings. The wild fishery has also increased as disease resistance is developing naturally in the wild stocks, but remains {\textasciitilde}5\% of peak landings. Improved management has assisted in this recent limited recovery, improving these efforts further by enhancing stock recovery via large no-take sanctuaries, among other actions, could assist in stock recovery.},

              Metapopulation and source–sink dynamics are increasingly considered within spatially explicit management of wildlife populations, yet the application of these concepts has generally been limited to comparisons of the performance (e.g., demographic rates or dispersal) inside vs. outside protected areas, and at spatial scales that do not encompass an entire metapopulation. In the present study, a spatially explicit, size‐structured matrix model was applied to simulate the dynamics of an Eastern oyster ( 
              Crassostrea virginica 
              ) metapopulation in the second largest estuary in the United States—the Albemarle‐Pamlico Estuarine System in North Carolina. The model integrated larval dispersal simulations with empirical measures of oyster demographic rates to simulate the dynamics of the entire oyster metapopulation consisting of 646 reefs and five reef types: (1) restored subtidal reefs closed to harvest (i.e., sanctuaries or protected areas; 
              n 
               = 14), (2) restored subtidal reefs open to harvest ( 
              n 
               = 53), (3) natural subtidal reefs open to harvest ( 
              n 
               = 301), (4) natural intertidal reefs open to harvest ( 
              n 
               = 129), and (5) oyster reefs on manmade, hard structures such as seawalls ( 
              n 
               = 149). Key findings included (1) an overall stable, yet slightly declining oyster metapopulation, (2) variable reef type‐specific population trajectories, largely dependent on spatiotemporal variation in larval recruitment, (3) a greater relative importance of inter‐reef larval connectivity on metapopulation dynamics than local larval retention processes, and (4) spatiotemporal variation in the source–sink status of reef subpopulations wherein subtidal sanctuaries and reefs located in the northeastern portion of the estuary were frequent sources. From a management perspective, continued protection of oyster sanctuaries is warranted. Sanctuaries represented only 6.2\% of the total reef area, however, they harbored 19\% (± 2\%) of all oysters and produced 25\% (± 6\%) of all larvae settling within the metapopulation. Additional management priorities should focus on restoration or conservation of subpopulations that serve as frequent source subpopulations (including those with poor demographic rates, but high connectivity potential), and management of harvest from sink subpopulations. The application of a source–sink framework and similar integrated modeling approach could inform management of oysters in other systems, as well as other species that exhibit similar metapopulation characteristics.},

            Global declines of foundation species have reduced ecological function at population, community, and ecosystem levels. Restoration of foundation species promises to counter such losses, despite unknown recovery timelines, undefined benchmarks, and uncertainty about whether restored ecosystems approximate natural ones. Here, we demonstrate through a 15‐year large‐scale experiment in coastal Virginia, USA, that restored oyster reefs can quickly recover multiple ecological functions and match natural reefs. Specifically, abundances of oysters and a key crab mesopredator on restored reefs equaled reference reefs in approximately 6 years, indicating that restoration can initiate rapid, sustained recovery of foundation species and associated consumers. As reefs matured and accrued biomass, they became more temporally stable, suggesting that restoration can increase resilience and may stabilize those ecosystem processes that scale with foundation species biomass. Together, these results demonstrate that restoration can catalyze rapid recovery of imperiled coastal foundation species, reclaim lost community interactions, and help reverse decades of degradation.},

	abstract = {Historic declines in oyster populations have resulted in diminished production of ecosystem services and habitat function in many estuaries. Due to the important role of oysters in ecosystem function, scientists and resource managers have employed oyster reef restoration to mitigate declines, recover essential ecosystem services, and better habitat function. Yet, there are knowledge gaps regarding the impact of restoration efforts on ecologically valuable mid-trophic level organisms inhabiting these systems. To address this knowledge gap, here we quantify macroinvertebrate species abundance, community diversity, and composition on experimental restored oyster reefs before and after restoration, and from live (positive control) and dead (negative control) reefs in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida. Species diversity and composition on restored reefs shifted towards states similar to live (positive control) reefs within 12 months of restoration. Recovery of species abundance occurred within 18 months of restoration. The results presented herein quantify the effect of restoration on resident macroinvertebrates and provide timelines of recovery for each attribute of these communities. Further, this study presents an actionable and transferable framework for identifying effective single-species metrics of restoration success across ecosystems. The application of this framework will provide managers and researchers with tools to improve the efficiency and efficacy of post-restoration monitoring. By doing so, this study contributes significantly to the improvement of broader restoration practices in an era of unprecedented habitat loss.},

In the state of Florida, USA, dozens of estuarine habitat restoration projects are underway. These projects have traditionally relied on both natural and man-made materials, including plastics. As the impacts of plastics on marine ecosystems are better understood, practitioners are increasingly focused on plastic-free restoration. To better understand this transition, we surveyed Florida restoration practitioners in April 2021 to capture current non-plastic restoration project trends and their status. Our descriptive survey goals were to understand: (1) what non-plastic materials have been tested, (2) trade-offs between plastic and non-plastic materials (e.g., cost, sourcing, volunteer engagement), and (3) the performance of non-plastic materials. Responses indicated that a variety of non-plastic materials are currently being used, including rock, cement-infused jute structures, cement Reef Balls™ (Reef Ball Foundation, USA), BESE-elements®, and metal gabions. Overall, these materials are more expensive and equally or more difficult to install than previously popular plastic-based materials. No “best” non-plastic material emerged from our survey in part because many novel materials have been deployed for under three years. Long-term performance under a variety of abiotic and biotic conditions is thus a future research priority.},

Here, we quantified the recovery of faunal biodiversity and abundance toward a predisturbed state following structural restoration of oyster habitats globally. We found that while restoration initiates a rapid increase in biodiversity and abundance of reef-associated species within 2 years, recovery rate then decreases substantially, leaving a global shortfall in recovery of 35\% below a predisturbed state. While efficient restoration methods boost recovery and minimize recovery shortfalls, the time to full recovery is yet to be quantified. Therefore, potential future coastal development should weigh up not only the instantaneous damage to ecosystem functions but also the potential for generational loss of services.

Accumulating evidence shows that predation on reef-building oysters can be intense and potentially compromise efforts to restore or conserve these globally decimated foundation species. However, understanding the controls on variation in oyster predation strength is impeded by inconsistencies in experimental methodologies. To address this challenge, we conducted the first meta-analysis to quantify the magnitude, uncertainty, and drivers of predator effects on oysters. We synthesized 384 predator-exclusion experiments from 49 peer-reviewed publications over 45 years of study (1977 to 2021). We characterized geographic and temporal patterns in oyster predation experiments, determined the strength of predator effects on oyster mortality and recruitment, and assessed how predation varies with oyster size, environmental conditions, the predator assemblage, and experimental design. Predators caused an average 4.3× increase in oyster mortality and 46\% decrease in recruitment. Predation increased with oyster size and varied with predator identity and richness. Unexpectedly, we found no effects of latitude, tidal zone, or tidal range on predation strength. Predator effects differed with experiment type and tethering method, indicating the importance of experimental design and the caution warranted in extrapolating results. Our results quantify the importance of predation for oyster populations and suggest that consideration of the drivers of oyster predation in restoration and conservation planning may hasten recovery of these lost coastal foundation species.},

In 2018, the timing of gametogenesis and spawning was observed June–August for 2-year-old oysters from three distinct ancestries (native, hatchery, aquaculture), outplanted at age 1 month along the salinity gradient (3–30 psu) of a temperate estuary. A second season of data was collected in 2019 from a 3-year-old aquaculture line and mixed-age native adult oysters dredged and transplanted 1 year prior. Dermo was tested in 2019 and prevalence was 1.3\% (n = 240). Gametogenesis and spawning were retarded for all ancestries at low salinity relative to higher salinity sites during July and August. The reverse pattern was found in June, with low salinity sites having more advanced gonad index than at a high salinity site. This difference in average gonad index was 2.65 vs 1.46, respectively, for the native line and 2.62 vs 2.08 for aquaculture. Low salinity seemed to not only induce earlier gametogenesis in June, but also extended the reproductive season relative to higher salinity sites. Among oyster ancestries, the aquaculture line stood out as having 30–48\% lower gametogenic synchrony within sites, but only in 2018. Because the native oysters used in this study have been restricted to low salinity conditions for many generations, demonstration of their reproductive plasticity across salinities is notable and broadens the range of potential future restoration strategies.},

            Restoration aims to reverse the global declines of foundation species, but it is unclear how project attributes, the physical setting, and antecedent conditions affect restoration success. In coastal seas worldwide, oyster reef restoration is increasing to counter historical habitat destruction and associated declines in fisheries production and biodiversity. Yet, restoration outcomes are highly variable and the factors that enhance oyster production and nekton abundance and diversity on restored reefs are unresolved. To quantify the drivers of oyster restoration success, we used meta‐analysis to synthesize data from 158 restored reefs paired with unstructured habitats along the United States Gulf and Atlantic coasts. The average recovery of oyster production was 65\% greater in subtidal (vs. intertidal) zones, 173\% greater in polyhaline (vs. mesohaline) environments and increased with tidal range, demonstrating that physical conditions can strongly influence the restoration success of foundation species. Additionally, restoration increased the relative abundance and richness of nektonic fishes and invertebrates over time as reefs aged (at least 8 years post‐construction). Thus, the restoration benefits for provisioning habitat and enhancing biodiversity accrue over time, highlighting that restoration projects need multiple years to maximize ecosystem functions. Furthermore, long‐term monitoring of restored and control sites is needed to assess restoration outcomes and associated drivers. Last, our work reveals data constraints for several potential drivers of restoration outcomes, including reef construction material, reef dimensions, harvest pressure and disease prevalence. More experimental and observational studies are needed to target these factors and measure them with consistent methods across studies. Our findings indicate that the assisted recovery of foundation species yields several enhancements to ecosystem services, but such benefits are mediated by time and environmental conditions.},

              , are commercially important coastal species that provide many ecosystem services for coastal communities. Unfortunately, 85\% of oyster reefs have been lost globally, prompting investments in restoration efforts to rebuild populations. Managers often consider several well-studied environmental and water quality parameters when making restoration site decisions. However, recent research suggests that submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) may play a role in driving the distribution of oysters in some estuaries. Specifically, SGD may result in localized areas of low dissolved oxygen and low pH that could inhibit oyster recruitment and survival. However, SGD may interact with other potential oyster stressors, including creek geomorphology. On point bars, sediment accumulation could alter growth rates of oysters and physiology, and it is possible that the two factors, SGD and creek geomorphology, could interact to impact oyster growth. We conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of SGD and creek geomorphology on oyster growth rates in a marsh-lined tidal creek in Georgia, USA. High and low SGD sites were paired within point bars and cut banks. Oysters were deployed in cages for 72 days and growth rates were determined. We found a significant interaction between SGD and creek geomorphology on oyster growth rates. Oysters grew at significantly faster rates at locations on accretionary point bars regardless of SGD flux, whereas, on erosional cut banks, high SGD flux significantly reduced oyster growth rate relative to low SGD flux. It appears that SGD may negatively influence oyster growth at specific creek locations, likely due to the presence of other stressors. Therefore, it is important to consider potential interacting and confounding stressors when managing oyster populations. As SGD is still a relatively understudied potential stressor for oysters, it is critical to continue to examine how groundwater might influence oysters in other locations and in combination with other stressors. Regardless, this study provides further evidence that SGD should be considered in future management efforts.},

Funding limitations can prevent adequate monitoring, but we suggest that the lack of accepted metrics to address the diversity of restoration objectives also presents a serious challenge to the monitoring of restoration projects. A working group with experience in designing and monitoring oyster reef projects was used to develop standardized monitoring metrics, units, and performance criteria that would allow for comparison among restoration sites and projects of various construction types. A set of four universal metrics (reef areal dimensions, reef height, oyster density, and oyster size–frequency distribution) and a set of three universal environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen) are recommended to be monitored for all oyster habitat restoration projects regardless of their goal(s). In addition, restoration goal‐based metrics specific to four commonly cited ecosystem service‐based restoration goals are recommended, along with an optional set of seven supplemental ancillary metrics that could provide information useful to the interpretation of prerestoration and postrestoration monitoring data. Widespread adoption of a common set of metrics with standardized techniques and units to assess well‐defined goals not only allows practitioners to gauge the performance of their own projects but also allows for comparison among projects, which is both essential to the advancement of the field of oyster restoration and can provide new knowledge about the structure and ecological function of oyster reef ecosystems.},

By comparing costs to ecosystem service benefits, we discovered that the return‐on‐investment of oyster restoration varies widely, but generally increases with project size.

              Although species interactions are often assumed to be strongest at small spatial scales, they can interact with regional environmental factors to modify food web dynamics across biogeographic scales. The eastern oyster (
              Crassostrea virginica
              ) is a widespread foundational species of both ecological and economic importance. The oyster and its associated assemblage of fish and macroinvertebrates is an ideal system to investigate how regional differences in environmental variables influence trophic interactions and food web structure. We quantified multiple environmental factors, oyster reef properties, associated species, and trophic guilds on intertidal oyster reefs within 10 estuaries along 900 km of the southeastern United States. Geographical gradients in fall water temperature and mean water depth likely influenced regional (i.e., the northern, central and southern sections of the SAB) variation in oyster reef food web structure. Variation in the biomass of mud crabs, an intermediate predator, was mostly (84.1\%) explained by reefs within each site, and did not differ substantially among regions; however, regional variation in the biomass of top predators and of juvenile oysters also contributed to biogeographic variation in food web structure. In particular, region explained almost half (40.2\%) of the variation in biomass of predators of blue crab, a top predator that was prevalent only in the central region where water depth was greater. Field experiments revealed that oyster mortality due to predation was greatest in the central region, suggesting spatial variation in the importance of trophic cascades. However, high oyster recruitment in the middle region probably compensates for this enhanced predation, potentially explaining why relatively less variation (17.9\%) in oyster cluster biomass was explained by region. Region also explained over half of the variation in biomass of mud crab predators (55.2\%), with the southern region containing almost an order of magnitude more biomass than the other two regions. In this region, higher water temperatures in the fall corresponded with higher biomass of fish that consume mud crabs and of fish that consume juvenile and forage fish, whereas biomas of their prey (mud crabs and juvenile and forage fish, respectively) was generally low in the southern region. Collectively, these results show how environmental gradients interact with trophic cascades to structure food webs associated with foundation species across biogeographic regions.},

              Foundation species structure communities, promote biodiversity, and stabilize ecosystem processes by creating locally stable environmental conditions. Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both. Here we tested the hypothesis that the stability of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp
              Macrocystis pyrifera
              , increased the stability of the aggregate biomass of a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of understory algae and sessile invertebrates that compete for space beneath the giant kelp canopy. To achieve this goal, we analyzed an 18‐yr time series of the biomass of giant kelp and its associated benthic community collected from 32 plots distributed among nine shallow reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. We showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp's direct positive association with species richness. The stability of all community types was positively related to species richness via increased species stability and species asynchrony. The stabilizing effects of richness were three to four times stronger when algae and invertebrates were considered separately rather than in combination. Our finding that diversity–stability relationships were stronger in communities consisting of species with similar resource requirements suggests that competition for shared resources rather than differential responses to environmental conditions played a more important role in stabilizing the community. Increasing threats to structure‐forming foundation species worldwide necessitates a detailed understanding of how they influence their associated community. This study is among the first to show that dampened temporal fluctuations in the biomass of a foundation species is an important determinant of the stability of the complex communities it supports.},

            Historical ecology has revolutionized our understanding of fisheries and cultural landscapes, demonstrating the value of historical data for evaluating the past, present, and future of Earth’s ecosystems. Despite several important studies, Indigenous fisheries generally receive less attention from scholars and managers than the 17th–20th century capitalist commercial fisheries that decimated many keystone species, including oysters. We investigate Indigenous oyster harvest through time in North America and Australia, placing these data in the context of sea level histories and historical catch records. Indigenous oyster fisheries were pervasive across space and through time, persisting for 5000–10,000 years or more. Oysters were likely managed and sometimes “farmed,” and are woven into broader cultural, ritual, and social traditions. Effective stewardship of oyster reefs and other marine fisheries around the world must center Indigenous histories and include Indigenous community members to co-develop more inclusive, just, and successful strategies for restoration, harvest, and management.},

            The global expansion of aquaculture has raised concerns about its environmental impacts, including effects on wildlife. Aquaculture farms are thought to repel some species and function as either attractive population sinks (‘ecological traps’) or population sources for others. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of empirical studies documenting interactions between aquaculture operations and vertebrate wildlife. Farms were associated with elevated local abundance and diversity of wildlife, although this overall effect was strongly driven by aggregations of wild fish at sea cages and shellfish farms (abundance: 72×; species richness: 2.0×). Birds were also more diverse at farms (1.1×), but other taxa showed variable and comparatively small effects. Larger effects were reported when researchers selected featureless or unstructured habitats as reference sites. Evidence for aggregation ‘hotspots’ is clear in some systems, but we cannot determine whether farms act as ecological traps for most taxa, as few studies assess either habitat preference or fitness in wildlife. Fish collected near farms were larger and heavier with no change in body condition, but also faced higher risk of disease and parasitism. Birds and mammals were frequently reported preying on stock, but little data exist on the outcomes of such interactions for birds and mammals – farms are likely to function as ecological traps for many species. We recommend researchers measure survival and reproduction in farm‐associated wildlife to make direct, causal links between aquaculture and its effects on wildlife populations.},

During 2018, underwater cameras were mounted on four study cages at a dense shellfish farm of 40-100 commercial cages (dense cage farm), on four single cages interspersed on low relief seafloor (sparse cage farm), and amongst four boulders on a rock reef (rock reef), within an embayment off Milford, Connecticut, which is part of Long Island Sound, in the United States. In 2019, cameras were similarly deployed on two study cages per farm at each of three shellfish farms off Milford, Norwalk and Westport, CT. Video was recorded hourly in eight-minute segments from 7 am to 7 pm. Data loggers monitored seawater temperature, light intensity, and current speed. Fish abundance (MaxN) was calculated for all videos. We compared fish abundance and community composition between May and September, on cage and boulder habitat, on cages at dense and sparse farms and on cages across farm locations. In 2018, abundance of black sea bass (

However pairwise comparisons indicated that cunner were significantly higher at the sparse cage farm versus the rock reef but cunner abundance on the dense cage farm and rock reef sites was not significantly different. Abundance of black sea bass, scup, tautog, and cunner were not significantly different across 2019 farm locations. Young-of-the-year fish occurred episodically at all sites during both years, with black sea bass and scup most abundant. Fish abundance corresponded to seasonal changes in seawater temperature and was highest at the warmest temperatures. Light intensity and current speed explained less variation in fish abundance relative to temperature, and relationships were inconsistent across habitats and farm locations Our results suggest that multi-tiered oyster aquaculture cages contribute structure to seafloor environments that provide habitat for temperate reef fish similar to natural rock reefs.},

            Recent literature on marine fish farming brands it as potentially compatible with sustainable resource use, conservation, and human nutrition goals, and aligns with the emerging policy discourse of ‘blue growth’. We advance a two-pronged critique. First, contemporary narratives tend to overstate marine finfish aquaculture’s potential to deliver food security and environmental sustainability. Second, they often align with efforts to enclose maritime space that could facilitate its allocation to extractive industries and conservation interests and exclude fishers. Policies and investments that seek to increase the availability and accessibility of affordable and sustainable farmed aquatic foods should focus on freshwater aquaculture.},

            Heightening human impacts on the Earth result in widespread losses of production and conservation values and make large‐scale ecosystem restoration increasingly urgent. Tackling this problem requires the development of general guiding principles for restoration so that we can move away from the ad hoc, site‐ and situation‐specific approach that now prevails. A continuum of restoration efforts can be recognized, ranging from restoration of localized highly degraded sites to restoration of entire landscapes for production and/or conservation reasons. We emphasize the importance of developing restoration methodologies that are applicable at the landscape scale. Key processes in restoration include identifying and dealing with the processes leading to degradation in the first place, determining realistic goals and measures of success, developing methods for implementing the goals and incorporating them into land‐management and planning strategies, and monitoring the restoration and assessing its success. Few of these procedures are currently incorporated in many restoration projects. The concept that many ecosystems are likely to exist in alternative stable states, depending on their history, is relevant to the setting of restoration goals. A range of measures, such as those being developed to measure ecosystem health, could be used to develop “scorecards” for restoration efforts. Generalizable guidelines for restoration on individual sites could be based on the concepts of designed disturbance, controlled colonization, and controlled species performance. Fewer explicit guidelines are available at the landscape scale, beyond nonquantitative generalities about size and connectivity. Development of these guidelines is an important priority so that urgent large‐scale restoration can be planned and implemented effectively.},

Regulatory and management efforts to enhance nutrient export from coastal ecosystems include sustainable oyster aquaculture that removes nitrogen in the form of oyster biomass and increases particulate export to underlying sediments where increased organic material may enhance microbial denitrification. To better understand the impacts of oyster aquaculture on nitrogen removal, we examined bacterial processes in sediments underlying three of the most common aquaculture methods that vary in the proximity of oysters to the sediments. Sediment samples underlying sites managed with these different aquaculture methods were examined using the 16S rRNA gene to assess microbial community structure, gene expression analyses to examine nitrogen and sulfur cycling genes, and nitrogen gas flux measurements. All sites were located in the same hydrodynamic setting within Waquoit Bay, MA during 2018 and 2019. Although sediments under the different oyster farming practices showed similar communities, ordination analysis revealed discrete community groups formed along the sampling season. Measured N

              fluxes and expression of key genes involved in denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) increased during mid-summer and into fall in both years primarily under bottom cages. While all three oyster growing methods enhanced nitrogen removal relative to the control site, gene expression data indicate that the nitrogen retaining process of DNRA is particularly enhanced after end of July under bottom cages, and to a lesser extent, under suspended and floating bags. The choice of gear can also potentially increase processes that induce nitrogen retention in the form of ammonia in the underlying sediments over time, thus causing deviations from predicted nitrogen removal. If nitrogen removal is a primary objective, monitoring for these shifts is essential for making decisions about siting and size of aquaculture sites from year to year.},

Foundation species largely operate via non‐trophic interactions, presenting a challenge to incorporating them into food web models. Here, we used non‐linear, bioenergetic predator‐prey models to explore the role of foundation species and their non‐trophic effects. We explored four types of models in which the foundation species reduced the metabolic rates of species in a specific trophic position. We examined the outcomes of each of these models for six metabolic rate “treatments” in which the foundation species altered the metabolic rates of associated species by one‐tenth to ten times their allometric baseline metabolic rates. For each model simulation, we looked at how foundation species influenced food web structure during community assembly and the subsequent change in food web structure when the foundation species was removed. When a foundation species lowered the metabolic rate of only basal species, the resultant webs were complex, species‐rich, and robust to foundation species removals. On the other hand, when a foundation species lowered the metabolic rate of only consumer species, all species, or no species, the resultant webs were species‐poor and the subsequent removal of the foundation species resulted in the further loss of species and complexity. This suggests that in nature we should look for foundation species to predominantly facilitate basal species.},

            Global declines in foundation species and associated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services have made restoration of foundation species and the habitats they create a top priority. Because restoration success has been highly variable, the field is increasingly using both experimentation and ecological theory to augment success. We conducted a meta‐analysis of studies (18) in estuarine and marine systems, which increased the abundance of top predators as a restoration approach, thus improving biogenic habitat‐forming foundation species recovery by reducing consumers. Beyond testing the general idea of whether top predator addition enhances foundation species restoration, we examined whether the degree of restoration success could be explained by classic predictors of top‐down strength, such as taxonomic identity of the foundation species and top predators, direct and indirect effects of top predators, and the latitude and duration of the study. Top predators successfully elicited a trophic cascade by decreasing consumer abundances (direct effect) and increasing foundation species recovery (indirect effect) when compared with control restoration projects without top predators. Direct effects are expected to be stronger than indirect effects, in accordance with classic ecological theory. We found no evidence of magnitude differences between direct and indirect effects of top predator addition. Increasing invertebrate top predators produced a 3.5× greater increase in the basal trophic level than adding vertebrate top predators. Despite the strong effect of predator type, the log response ratio of all foundation species types (algae, animal, and plant) increased 10‐fold in top predator addition treatments. We found diminishing effects of top predator addition as study duration increased, which supports recent developments that the positive effects of marine protected area designation decline over time. Our results highlight the promise of harnessing top‐down control via top predator addition as a mechanism to aid foundation species recovery.},

On rocky shores, rockweeds (large brown algae in the Order Fucales) have the potential to provide habitat and ameliorate stress for mobile invertebrates. To determine the relative role of 2 rockweeds (
              Silvetia compressa
              and
              Pelvetiopsis
              spp.) as foundation species at sites along a latitudinal gradient, we conducted observational surveys and then initiated a 12 mo removal experiment. We found that richness and abundance of mobile invertebrates declined over time when rockweeds were removed, but only at the southernmost site. In contrast, at our other sites, there was no change in the richness and abundance of mobile invertebrates following rockweed removal. At the southern site, rockweeds played an important role in maintaining mobile invertebrate diversity. At our central and northern sites, rockweeds were less important in maintaining the diversity of mobile invertebrates. At these sites, alternative species, including bladed and branching taxa in the genera

However, these alternative foundation species are rare to absent at the southern site, potentially due to greater physical stress. The loss of rockweed foundation species, which are declining at our southern site, can have cascading effects by causing local co-extinctions of associated species. This study highlights the importance of foundation species, especially in areas where their functional redundancy is low, and how the loss of foundation species can alter diversity, leading to potential changes in ecosystem functioning.},

              Marine foundation species are critical to the structure and resilience of coastal ecosystems and provide key ecosystem services. Since many have suffered severe population declines, restoration of foundation species has been undertaken worldwide. The Olympia oyster (
              Ostrea lurida
              ) is a foundation species, and the restoration of depleted populations is a priority for maintaining ecosystem function of estuaries along the west coast of North America. Here, we synthesize all native oyster restoration projects conducted from California, USA, to British Columbia, Canada, and analyze project goals, methods, and outcomes. Currently, restoration projects are spread unevenly across the species’ range, driven by locally varying goals and implemented with contrasting approaches. We highlight the value of regional strategic planning and decision support tools to evaluate project design and methods for restoration, including the selection of substrates and the targeted use of aquaculture. We recommend future investment in larger projects, which our analysis found were more cost-effective, but which have been relatively rare for this species. We also recommend that funders support monitoring over broader temporal and spatial scales than in the past to better characterize long-term effects of restoration on oyster populations and the services they provide beyond the project footprint. We found that most projects successfully supported native oysters and engaged local communities, and recommend similar efforts to continue to enhance understanding of Olympia oysters, which remain unfamiliar to many coastal residents. We believe that the results of this synthesis are broadly applicable to marine foundation species generally, and can inform restoration and conservation efforts worldwide.},

              Many coastal habitat restoration projects are focused on restoring the population of a single foundation species to recover an entire ecological community. Estimates of the ecosystem services provided by the restoration project are used to justify, prioritize, and evaluate such projects. However, estimates of ecosystem services provided by a single species may vastly under‐represent true provisioning, as we demonstrate here with an example of oyster reefs, often restored to improve estuarine water quality. In the brackish Chesapeake Bay, the hooked mussel
              Ischadium recurvum
              can have greater abundance and biomass than the focal restoration species, the eastern oyster
              Crassostrea virginica
              . We measured the temperature‐dependent phytoplankton clearance rates of both bivalves and their filtration efficiency on three size classes of phytoplankton to parameterize an annual model of oyster reef filtration, with and without hooked mussels, for monitored oyster reefs and restoration scenarios in the eastern Chesapeake Bay. The inclusion of filtration by hooked mussels increased the filtration capacity of the habitat greater than 2‐fold. Hooked mussels were also twice as effective as oysters at filtering picoplankton (1.5–3 µm), indicating that they fill a distinct ecological niche by controlling phytoplankton in this size class, which makes up a significant proportion of the phytoplankton load in summer. When mussel and oyster filtration are accounted for in this, albeit simplistic, model, restoration of oyster reefs in a tributary scale restoration is predicted to control 100\% of phytoplankton during the summer months.},

            Restoration of foundation species promises to reverse environmental degradation and return lost ecosystem services, but a lack of standardized evaluation across projects limits understanding of recovery, especially in marine systems. Oyster reefs are restored to reverse massive global declines and reclaim valuable ecosystem services, but the success of these projects has not been systematically and comprehensively quantified. We synthesized data on ecosystem services associated with oyster restoration from 245 pairs of restored and degraded reefs and 136 pairs of restored and reference reefs across 3500 km of U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastlines. On average, restoration was associated with a 21‐fold increase in oyster production (mean log response ratio = 3.08 [95\% confidence interval: 2.58–3.58]), 34–97\% enhancement of habitat provisioning (mean community abundance = 0.51 [0.41–0.61], mean richness = 0.29 [0.19–0.39], and mean biomass = 0.69 [0.39–0.99]), 54\% more nitrogen removal (mean = 0.43 [0.13–0.73]), and 89–95\% greater sediment nutrients (mean = 0.67 [0.27–1.07]) and organic matter (mean = 0.64 [0.44–0.84]) relative to degraded habitats. Moreover, restored reefs matched reference reefs for these ecosystem services. Our results support the continued and expanded use of oyster restoration to enhance ecosystem services of degraded coastal systems and match many functions provided by reference reefs.

            Resumen
            La restauración de especies fundadoras promete revertir la degradación ambiental y restituir servicios ambientales perdidos, pero la falta de evaluación estandarizada de proyectos limita la comprensión de la recuperación, especialmente en sistemas marinos. Los bancos de ostión son restaurados para revertir declinaciones globales masivas y recuperar servicios ecosistémicos valiosos, pero el éxito de estos proyectos no ha sido cuantificado sistemática ni integralmente. Sintetizamos datos sobre los servicios ecosistémicos asociados con la restauración de ostiones de 245 pares de bancos restaurados y degradados y 136 pares de bancos restaurados y de referencia a lo largo de 3500 km de costa del Golfo de México y Atlántico norteamericanos. En promedio, la restauración se asoció con un incremento de 21 veces en la producción de ostión (media de proporción de respuesta log = 3.08 [95\% IC 2.58‐3.58]), mejoras entre 34 y 97\% en el aprovisionamiento de hábitat (abundancia media = 0.51 [0.41‐0.61], riqueza media = 0.29 [0.19‐0.39], y biomasa media = 0.69 [0.39‐0.99]), 54\% más remoción de nitrógeno (media = 0.43 [0.13‐0.73]), y 89–95\% más nutrientes en sedimento (media = 0.67 [0.27‐1.07]) y materia orgánica (media = 0.64 [0.44‐0.84]) en relación con hábitats degradados. Más aun, estos servicios ecosistémicos de los bancos restaurados fueron muy similares en los bancos de referencia. Nuestros resultados sustentan el uso continuo y expandido de la restauración de ostiones para mejorar los servicios ecosistémicos de sistemas costeros degradados y que sean parecidos a las numerosas funciones proporcionadas por los bancos de referencia.

	abstract = {Oyster reefs provide important services to ecosystems and people, with many of these benefits depending on structurally complex reef habitat. Despite the key role of oyster reef habitat, we have yet to understand natural and anthropogenic drivers of subtidal reef habitat over large spatial scales ({\textgreater}200 km). Chesapeake Bay (USA) offers a valuable system to explore how salinity, restoration, and harvest compare in their influence on subtidal oyster reef habitat because of its broad environmental gradient and mosaic of management types. We applied a remote rapid assessment method using underwater photographs to survey oyster reef habitat in 12 tributaries and scored images based on estimates of oyster percent cover and vertical relief. The broad spatial scale ({\textasciitilde}215 km) of the survey includes reefs that vary in management status and salinity. Bay-wide habitat scores were higher with greater estimated oyster percent cover and vertical relief on unharvested and restored reefs. Salinity also contributed to Chesapeake Bay-wide patterns, but the relationship depended on harvest status. In assessing the separate management jurisdictions, scores were higher on restored reefs in Maryland and on anthropogenic (i.e. artificially supplemented) reefs in Virginia. A time series over 4 yr in 2 Maryland tributaries showed high and persistent habitat scores in restored sanctuaries, but habitat scores increased for all reefs over time. The results highlight the combined roles of the natural environment and management decisions on oyster reef habitat. The effect of harvest and restoration on habitat underscores the importance of local management decisions in determining the future status of oyster reefs.},
