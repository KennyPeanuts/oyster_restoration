          <li>The kelp prevent the growth of benthic algae via shading, which permits the development of a benthic invertebrate community. Following storms which remove the kelp canopy, the algae community will develop only if the storm also reduced the benthic invertebrate community, otherwise the algae cannot compete. So, both the algae and benthic invertebrates are the dominant competitor if established but the kelp is only one part of the set of biotic and abiotic factors that alter the benthic community structure.</li>
