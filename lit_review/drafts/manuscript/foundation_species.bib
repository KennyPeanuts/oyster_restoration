              Foundation species structure communities, promote biodiversity, and stabilize ecosystem processes by creating locally stable environmental conditions. Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both. Here we tested the hypothesis that the stability of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp
              Macrocystis pyrifera
              , increased the stability of the aggregate biomass of a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of understory algae and sessile invertebrates that compete for space beneath the giant kelp canopy. To achieve this goal, we analyzed an 18‐yr time series of the biomass of giant kelp and its associated benthic community collected from 32 plots distributed among nine shallow reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. We showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp's direct positive association with species richness. The stability of all community types was positively related to species richness via increased species stability and species asynchrony. The stabilizing effects of richness were three to four times stronger when algae and invertebrates were considered separately rather than in combination. Our finding that diversity–stability relationships were stronger in communities consisting of species with similar resource requirements suggests that competition for shared resources rather than differential responses to environmental conditions played a more important role in stabilizing the community. Increasing threats to structure‐forming foundation species worldwide necessitates a detailed understanding of how they influence their associated community. This study is among the first to show that dampened temporal fluctuations in the biomass of a foundation species is an important determinant of the stability of the complex communities it supports.},

	abstract = {Foundation species are basal species that play an important role in determining community composition by physically structuring ecosystems and modulating ecosystem processes. Foundation species largely operate via non‐trophic interactions, presenting a challenge to incorporating them into food web models. Here, we used non‐linear, bioenergetic predator‐prey models to explore the role of foundation species and their non‐trophic effects. We explored four types of models in which the foundation species reduced the metabolic rates of species in a specific trophic position. We examined the outcomes of each of these models for six metabolic rate “treatments” in which the foundation species altered the metabolic rates of associated species by one‐tenth to ten times their allometric baseline metabolic rates. For each model simulation, we looked at how foundation species influenced food web structure during community assembly and the subsequent change in food web structure when the foundation species was removed. When a foundation species lowered the metabolic rate of only basal species, the resultant webs were complex, species‐rich, and robust to foundation species removals. On the other hand, when a foundation species lowered the metabolic rate of only consumer species, all species, or no species, the resultant webs were species‐poor and the subsequent removal of the foundation species resulted in the further loss of species and complexity. This suggests that in nature we should look for foundation species to predominantly facilitate basal species.},

            Global declines in foundation species and associated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services have made restoration of foundation species and the habitats they create a top priority. Because restoration success has been highly variable, the field is increasingly using both experimentation and ecological theory to augment success. We conducted a meta‐analysis of studies (18) in estuarine and marine systems, which increased the abundance of top predators as a restoration approach, thus improving biogenic habitat‐forming foundation species recovery by reducing consumers. Beyond testing the general idea of whether top predator addition enhances foundation species restoration, we examined whether the degree of restoration success could be explained by classic predictors of top‐down strength, such as taxonomic identity of the foundation species and top predators, direct and indirect effects of top predators, and the latitude and duration of the study. Top predators successfully elicited a trophic cascade by decreasing consumer abundances (direct effect) and increasing foundation species recovery (indirect effect) when compared with control restoration projects without top predators. Direct effects are expected to be stronger than indirect effects, in accordance with classic ecological theory. We found no evidence of magnitude differences between direct and indirect effects of top predator addition. Increasing invertebrate top predators produced a 3.5× greater increase in the basal trophic level than adding vertebrate top predators. Despite the strong effect of predator type, the log response ratio of all foundation species types (algae, animal, and plant) increased 10‐fold in top predator addition treatments. We found diminishing effects of top predator addition as study duration increased, which supports recent developments that the positive effects of marine protected area designation decline over time. Our results highlight the promise of harnessing top‐down control via top predator addition as a mechanism to aid foundation species recovery.},

	abstract = {Foundation species are vital to the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in many systems. On rocky shores, rockweeds (large brown algae in the Order Fucales) have the potential to provide habitat and ameliorate stress for mobile invertebrates. To determine the relative role of 2 rockweeds (
              Silvetia compressa
              and
              Pelvetiopsis
              spp.) as foundation species at sites along a latitudinal gradient, we conducted observational surveys and then initiated a 12 mo removal experiment. We found that richness and abundance of mobile invertebrates declined over time when rockweeds were removed, but only at the southernmost site. In contrast, at our other sites, there was no change in the richness and abundance of mobile invertebrates following rockweed removal. At the southern site, rockweeds played an important role in maintaining mobile invertebrate diversity. At our central and northern sites, rockweeds were less important in maintaining the diversity of mobile invertebrates. At these sites, alternative species, including bladed and branching taxa in the genera
              Mastocarpus
              ,
              Mazzaella

              Endocladia
              , co-occur with rockweeds and can buffer the system against their loss. However, these alternative foundation species are rare to absent at the southern site, potentially due to greater physical stress. The loss of rockweed foundation species, which are declining at our southern site, can have cascading effects by causing local co-extinctions of associated species. This study highlights the importance of foundation species, especially in areas where their functional redundancy is low, and how the loss of foundation species can alter diversity, leading to potential changes in ecosystem functioning.},

Shifts in baseline nutrient concentrations and temperature values from coastal upwelling influenced ecosystem metabolism in pools with intact foundation species. Our results indicate that as communities respond to foundation species loss, ecosystem functioning depends on the dominant community present and biologically or physically driven shifts in biogeochemistry.

              Marine foundation species are critical to the structure and resilience of coastal ecosystems and provide key ecosystem services. Since many have suffered severe population declines, restoration of foundation species has been undertaken worldwide. The Olympia oyster (
              Ostrea lurida
              ) is a foundation species, and the restoration of depleted populations is a priority for maintaining ecosystem function of estuaries along the west coast of North America. Here, we synthesize all native oyster restoration projects conducted from California, USA, to British Columbia, Canada, and analyze project goals, methods, and outcomes. Currently, restoration projects are spread unevenly across the species’ range, driven by locally varying goals and implemented with contrasting approaches. We highlight the value of regional strategic planning and decision support tools to evaluate project design and methods for restoration, including the selection of substrates and the targeted use of aquaculture. We recommend future investment in larger projects, which our analysis found were more cost-effective, but which have been relatively rare for this species. We also recommend that funders support monitoring over broader temporal and spatial scales than in the past to better characterize long-term effects of restoration on oyster populations and the services they provide beyond the project footprint. We found that most projects successfully supported native oysters and engaged local communities, and recommend similar efforts to continue to enhance understanding of Olympia oysters, which remain unfamiliar to many coastal residents. We believe that the results of this synthesis are broadly applicable to marine foundation species generally, and can inform restoration and conservation efforts worldwide.},

              Many coastal habitat restoration projects are focused on restoring the population of a single foundation species to recover an entire ecological community. Estimates of the ecosystem services provided by the restoration project are used to justify, prioritize, and evaluate such projects. However, estimates of ecosystem services provided by a single species may vastly under‐represent true provisioning, as we demonstrate here with an example of oyster reefs, often restored to improve estuarine water quality. In the brackish Chesapeake Bay, the hooked mussel
              Ischadium recurvum
              can have greater abundance and biomass than the focal restoration species, the eastern oyster
              Crassostrea virginica
              . We measured the temperature‐dependent phytoplankton clearance rates of both bivalves and their filtration efficiency on three size classes of phytoplankton to parameterize an annual model of oyster reef filtration, with and without hooked mussels, for monitored oyster reefs and restoration scenarios in the eastern Chesapeake Bay. The inclusion of filtration by hooked mussels increased the filtration capacity of the habitat greater than 2‐fold. Hooked mussels were also twice as effective as oysters at filtering picoplankton (1.5–3 µm), indicating that they fill a distinct ecological niche by controlling phytoplankton in this size class, which makes up a significant proportion of the phytoplankton load in summer. When mussel and oyster filtration are accounted for in this, albeit simplistic, model, restoration of oyster reefs in a tributary scale restoration is predicted to control 100\% of phytoplankton during the summer months.},

	doi = {10.1098/rspb.2015.0421},
	abstract = {Although there is mounting evidence that biodiversity is an important and widespread driver of ecosystem multifunctionality, much of this research has focused on small-scale biodiversity manipulations. Hence, which mechanisms maintain patches of enhanced biodiversity in natural systems and if these patches elevate ecosystem multifunctionality at both local and landscape scales remain outstanding questions. In a 17 month experiment conducted within southeastern United States salt marshes, we found that patches of enhanced biodiversity and multifunctionality arise only where habitat-forming foundation species overlap—i.e. where aggregations of ribbed mussels (
              Geukensia demissa
              ) form around cordgrass (
              Spartina alterniflora
              ) stems. By empirically scaling up our experimental results to the marsh platform at 12 sites, we further show that mussels—despite covering only approximately 1\% of the marsh surface—strongly enhance five distinct ecosystem functions, including decomposition, primary production and water infiltration rate, at the landscape scale. Thus, mussels create conditions that support the co-occurrence of high densities of functionally distinct organisms within cordgrass and, in doing so, elevate salt marsh multifunctionality from the patch to landscape scale. Collectively, these findings suggest that patterns in foundation species' overlap drive variation in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning within and across natural ecosystems. We therefore argue that foundation species should be integrated in our conceptual understanding of forces that moderate biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, approaches for conserving species diversity and strategies to improve the multifunctionality of degraded ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Canopy-forming fucoid algae have an important role as ecosystem engineers on rocky intertidal shores, where they increase the abundance of species otherwise limited by exposure during low tide. The facilitative relationship between
              Ascophyllum nodosum
              and associated organisms was explored using a frond breakage experiment (100\%, 50\%, 25\%, 0\% intact-frond treatments) in southern England, to assess the consequences of disturbance. Understorey substratum temperature was on average 3°C higher in 0\% and 25\% intact-frond treatments than in plots with 50\% and 100\% intact fronds. Light (as PAR during low tide) doubled in 0\% intact-frond treatments in comparison to other treatments (which had similar light levels). Mobile invertebrate species richness declined by on average 1 species per m
              2
              in the treatments with only 25\% and 0\% intact fronds, and the abundance of
              Littorina obtusata
              declined by 2.4–4.2 individuals per m
              2
              in the treatments with 25 and 0\% intact fronds. Sessile taxa, including
              Osmundea pinnatifida
              and encrusting coralline algae, declined by half on average in the 0\% intact-frond treatment. These results suggest that the ability of
              Ascophyllum
              to mediate environmental conditions to the understorey is the mechanism responsible for species distributed in the understorey (autogenic ecosystem engineering). The results of this study imply that a pulse disturbance resulting in a 50\% breakage of
              Ascophyllum
              fronds significantly increases temperature and decreases the abundance of mobile invertebrates usually associated with
              Ascophyllum
              . Sessile taxa associated with
              Ascophyllum
              can, however, withstand disturbances down to 25\% intact
              Ascophyllum
