         <li>"&hellip;the way to manage a resource is to stop its autonomous historical action"[p. 168]. I would extend Tsing's idea here to include a "service" as a resource and thus highlight the way that a focus on ecosystem services is to isolate it from its context.</li>
         <li>Tsing's idea of scalability (p. 38) seems also to apply to the ecosystem services model, in that the ecosystem services model views systems as an accumulation of services that are independent of each other and will scale with the system.</li>

         <li>In describing the facilitation interactions between humans, pine, and matsutake, Tsing writes: "landscapes&hellip; are products of <em>unintentional design</em>, that is, the overlapping world making activities of many agents, human and not human"[p. 152].</li>

          <li>"Through alienation, people and things become mobile assets; they can be removed from their life worlds&hellip; to be exchanged with other assets from other life worlds elsewhere"[p. 5]. Tsings concept of <em>alienation</em> is the process whereby living things are "turned into objects of exchange"[p. 121].</li>
          <li>"Scalability requires that project elements be oblivious to the indeterminacies of encounter&hellip;"[p. 38]. Tsing connects alienation to scalability in that both isolate people and nature from their relationships in order to benefit humans controlling the system.</li>
          <li>"'Salvage accumulation' is the process through which lead firms amass capital without controlling the conditions under which commodities are produced"[p. 63]. Although Tsing does not make this connection, salvage accumulation seems to describe the way that ecosystem services are designed to work; where processes that are non-capitalist and outside of the control of the capitalist system produce value that can be "salvaged" by the capitalist system.</li>
          <li>"Capitalism is a translation machine for producing capital from all kinds of livelihoods, human and not human"[p. 133]</li>
          <li>Tsing describes a category of <em>pericapitalist</em> space, which is a space that permits the flourishing of both capital and non-capitalist systems. Capitalist systems use pericapitalist spaces for salvage accumulation and translation to capital from non-capitalist systems [p. 301, note 2]. Although this may be an extension of Tsing's use, the ecosystem services model seems to seek to create pericaptialist spaces.</li>

          <li>Tsing uses the term "lifeways" to mean the <em>process</em> of being alive through time. "Lifeways" expands the concept of taxa to include history and process. Tsing writes: "[lifeways] are emergent effects of encounters"[p. 23].</li>
          <li>"Assemblages don't just gather lifeways; they make them."[p. 23] &mdash; This description of a system maps top the way that the foundation species model conceptualizes systems as defined by the ongoing effects of relationships.</li>
          <li>"Interspecies relations draw evolution back into history because they depend on the contingencies of encounter&hellip; interspecies encounters are always events, 'things that happen', the units of history."[p. 142]
