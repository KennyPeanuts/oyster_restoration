%oysterRock% Oyster rock is colloquial term for oyster reef habitat (see examples in Schulte 2017).

%atlas% Despite historically supporting oyster populations, the creeks are only rated as “moderate” candidates for restoration due to the lack of nearby oyster populations to supply propagules and degraded environmental conditions (Virginia Oyster Restoration Atlas, 2009).

%Schulte% Specifically in the case of oyster reefs, no one living has been witness to the pre-exploitation oyster populations of the Bay. There were already significant declines and warnings of their imperilment in the mid-nineteenth century (Schulte 2017), so our only evidence comes from oral and written histories.

%CBA% There is a failure to ask this question in the “10-billion Oysters” program of the Chesapeake Bay Oyster Alliance.

%gigas% This distinction is illustrated by the plan to introduce the pacific oyster (Crassotrea gigas) to the Chesapeake Bay in an effort to establish a disease-resistant population of oysters. This introduced oyster would have come far closer than any living shoreline to mimicking the structure and function the reefs of the native eastern oyster (Crassotrea virginica) but there was widespread agreement that this system would not be a true restoration of the oyster reefs of the Bay.
