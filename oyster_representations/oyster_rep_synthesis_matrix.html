        Ecosystems are <em>eco&ndash;historical</em> in that they are created from both relationships and history.

        Ecosystem services models lead to <em>alienation</em> of organisms from <em>eco&ndash;history</em>.

        Humans are part of the <em>eco&ndash;historical</em> structure of ecosystems not apart from it.

        Ecosystem services models <em>translate</em> organisms into capital and thus abstract them as resources.

        Oyster reefs are an example of alienation through ecosystem services models.

        Modelling oysters reefs as foundation species restores their <em>eco&ndash;historical</em> structure.
